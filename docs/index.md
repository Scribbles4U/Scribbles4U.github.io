<h1>Dealing with Procrastination</h1>
<h5>08/27/2023</h5>
It can be helpful to conciously reframe important tasks in your mind from "I need to [task]..." to "I'm going to [task]..." then immediately take the first action towards that task before you forget.  It seems like this shifts the task from the overwhelming void to the tendency for commitment.

<h1>Acceptance Comes from Within</h1>
<h5>08/25/2023</h5>
Quit waiting for people to accept what you say before you live your life.

<h1>Negotiation is Essential to Improve Quality of Life</h1>
<h5>08/24/2023</h5>
Be willing to negotiate for what you want.  Often times you will get a better deal simply by asking.  The people pleasing part of you may think it's selfish and greedy.  The other party can always say no and both parties can re-evaluate the terms.

There can be differences between cultures (ask vs guess).  It can be easy for us to stigmatize one over the other.  It's also important to not be unreasonable with our requests (give me your car).
